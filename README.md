## INFO

This App allows to scan the surrounding area to find all nearby pokemons and show them on map in real-time.

It doesn't require login and it doesn't access to Niantic servers, so it won't get you banned. It uses third party services.

Receive notifications when a pokemon on map is closer than a certain distance set by you!.

The notification system runs in background so it is not necessary to keep the app in foreground to receive notifications.

Furthermore it is possible to filter pokemons to just receive notification for those we are interested. So for example, if we don't want to recive notifications for the ubiquitous Zubats, we simply have to uncheck the corresponding box.

So to reassume, this app:
- scans the area to find Pokemons
- sends push notifications when a Pokemon is close to you
- runs in background!
- allows navigator instructions to reach pokemon on map
- filter your preferred pokemons!
- save, visualize and export spawn points!
- customizable parameters
